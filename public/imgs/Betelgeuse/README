INTRODUCTION
============

Betelgeuse is the name for a big star from Orion constellation. The
intention of this project is to create a complete, modern, clean and
eye-candy icon theme for the KDE Desktop Environment.

CONTRIBUTE
==========

There's a lot of work to do. Feel free to contribute to developing it!
You can do it at some ways:

  1. Creating and editing icons. If you think you've skills at icon
  designing and you know what Inkscape is (Thanks Karbon, your boolean
  operations with paths is a pain in the ass) you could help with it. You
  can clone the git repo at
  
  git@gitorious.org:betelgeuse/betelgeuse-sources.git

  and starting designing icons or make the changes you think they need.

  * Please DON'T make/edit and publish any icon as a standalone work. *
  I will give credits for all people that help with it, the idea is to
  keep this project unified as much as we can.

  * Please DON'T use any SVG filters, masks, blur and crap like that. *
  It makes them uncompatible with QtSVG. Please follow as much as you can
  the style of icons.

  2. Donating money. I'm just a poor graphic design student, seriously.
  I'm not receiving any cent, neither for this work. I even don't have
  any bank account so anybody could donate money via paypal. If somebody
  know how people can make donations so them can come here to Bogota
  (Colombia) please tell me. And a tablet would be very appreciated.
  Drawing with a creepy mouse is too hard. Or if you have a better
  computer and want to donate it... But even any buck would be very
  appreciated.

  3. If you know about shell scripting, you can help by fixing the
  build.sh file. I don't know too much about that and it could get
  better.

  4. Reporting issues, broken links and so on.

  5. Telling me your suggestions, ideas, complainments, insults and so
  on. Feedback is very appreciated.
